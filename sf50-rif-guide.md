# SF-50 Blocks 23, 24, and 26: Understanding Your RIF Protection

## Overview

This guide explains how Blocks 23, 24, and 26 on your Standard Form 50 (SF-50) affect your position during a federal Reduction in Force (RIF). These three blocks are critical in determining your retention standing if your agency undergoes workforce reductions.

## Block 23: Veterans Preference for Appointment

This block shows your veterans preference eligibility for hiring purposes, but it also affects RIF procedures.

### Possible Codes:
- **1** = None - No Veterans Preference
- **2** = 5-point preference (TP)
- **3** = 10-point/disability (XP)
- **4** = 10-point/compensable (CP)
- **5** = 10-point/other (XP)
- **6** = 10-point compensable/30%+ (CPS)
- **7** = No points/Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP)

### RIF Impact:
- **Code 6** provides the highest protection (Subgroup AD)
- **Codes 2-5, 7** provide moderate protection (Subgroup A)
- **Code 1** provides the lowest protection (Subgroup B)

## Block 24: Tenure

This block indicates your employment status and years of service.

### Possible Codes:
- **1** = Career employee (completed 3+ years of qualifying service)
- **2** = Career-conditional (less than 3 years of qualifying service or on probation)
- **3** = Temporary, term, or time-limited appointment

### RIF Impact:
- **Code 1** = Tenure Group I (highest protection)
- **Code 2** = Tenure Group II (moderate protection)
- **Code 3** = Tenure Group III (lowest protection)

## Block 26: Veterans Preference for RIF

This is the most critical block for RIF protection.

### Possible Values:
- **Yes/Checked** = Eligible for Veterans Preference in RIF
- **No/Blank** = Not eligible for Veterans Preference in RIF

## Special Rules for Military Retirees

### Dual Compensation Act of 1964 Restrictions

Military retirees face special restrictions under the Dual Compensation Act. **Most 20+ year military retirees do NOT qualify for veterans preference in RIF** unless they meet specific exceptions.

### Exceptions for Military Retirees:
1. **Combat-related retirement** - Retirement is directly based on combat-incurred disability
2. **Less than 20 years service** - Military retirement based on less than 20 years of active duty
3. **Continuous federal employment** - Working for the government since November 30, 1964, without a break of more than 30 days

### Examples:
- **20-year regular retiree with no combat disability**: Typically Block 26 = No
- **Medical retiree with combat-related disability**: Block 26 = Yes
- **Medical retiree with less than 20 years**: Block 26 = Yes

## RIF Protection Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)

1. **Group I-AD**: Career + 30%+ disabled veteran
2. **Group I-A**: Career + other veterans preference
3. **Group I-B**: Career + no veterans preference
4. **Group II-AD**: Conditional + 30%+ disabled veteran
5. **Group II-A**: Conditional + other veterans preference
6. **Group II-B**: Conditional + no veterans preference
7. **Group III-AD**: Temporary + 30%+ disabled veteran
8. **Group III-A**: Temporary + other veterans preference
9. **Group III-B**: Temporary + no veterans preference

## Common HR Errors

### Watch for these potential mistakes:
- Military retirees incorrectly coded with veterans preference when they shouldn't have it
- Veterans not receiving proper preference due to missing documentation
- Incorrect tenure coding affecting group placement
- Changes in VA disability ratings not reflected in personnel records

## What to Do if Your SF-50 is Wrong

1. **Gather documentation**: DD-214, VA rating letters, medical retirement orders
2. **Contact HR immediately**: Submit a personnel action request to correct errors
3. **Follow up persistently**: HR errors can significantly affect your RIF standing
4. **Keep records**: Document all communications about corrections

## Additional Considerations

### Performance Ratings
Your last three performance ratings also affect RIF standing by adding "additional service credit":
- Outstanding = 20 additional years
- Exceeds Fully Successful = 16 additional years
- Fully Successful = 12 additional years

### Length of Service
Within each subgroup, employees are ranked by total creditable federal civilian and military service.
